#RecommendIt

A simple iOS app that helps you keep track of recommendations. The idea came from Yelp’s bookmark feature -- but the problem is, there is no way to add notes to your bookmarks on a mobile device.

So, let’s say you’re talking restaurants to a co-worker. He tells you about this awesome seafood restaurant by the bay. Woah! Wait a minute! Gotta write this down!! Thing is, (a) we’re no longer in the 90s (who writes stuff down?!); and (b) you know you’re going to lose that piece of paper. That’s where RecommendIt comes in -- search for the restaurant, add some notes (you want to make sure you remember who told you about it so you can go back and scream/yell at them if it sucks!), and BOOM!, it’s on your list.

## Dev Stuff

This repo uses [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) for some of the auth stuff with Yelp. I honestly don’t remember. You shouldn’t have to do a `pod install` or anything like that -- all of the dependencies are in the repo. Just make sure you open the `.xcworkspace` file, or things will break -- guarentee it!
